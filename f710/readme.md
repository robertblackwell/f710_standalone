# F710

This repo provides some c++ code for reading the state of the two joysticks on a Logitech F710 game controller.

The purpose of this code is so that I can control a differential drive robot that I am building.

The way the code works is specific to how I want to drive my robot and is not in any way a generalized
F710 interface. For examples as it stands it does not read any of the buttons on the controller.
